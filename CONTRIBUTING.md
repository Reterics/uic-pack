I use **Conventional Commits** to keep the commit history organized and meaningful:

- **style**: Code formatting, white-space, etc.
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding or correcting tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

## Branching

- Always create a new branch (off `main`) for your changes.
- Use descriptive branch names to clarify the purpose or scope of the work.

## Pull Requests

- Keep PRs small and focused.

- Reference related issues or context for clarity.
